            <h3>Latest Projects</h3>
            <p>My latest project is a studio app that allows sound engineers and artists to review mixes and masters for 
                seamless interaction between artists and engineers without the hassle of sending files back and forth.</p>

             <p>Built my own LLM model that analyzes African Languages due to a lack of representation for African Langauges in LLM's. </p>
